My dad once told me his favorite restaurant in the world was House of Prime Rib in San Francisco, but it was nearly impossible to get a reservation. In response, I made Rezzy.

Rezzy is a Selenium script that automatically notifies the user if a spots opens up for a booked-out reservation. It is containerized using Docker and hosted on AWS Lambda.

Although the project is functional, it is still a work-in-progress, so please excuse some messy code and incomplete work-in-progress features!
