A few days ago, I asked my dad about his favorite restaurant he had ever eaten at. Without hesitation, he immediately said the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco. Just like that, Rezzy was born. 

Rezzy is a script that uses Selenium to automatically check if a reservation opens up for the House of Prime Rib during the few days my entire family will be visting in the Bay Area. It is hosted on AWS Lambda using Docker.
